## ⚠️ Rule 11: Mod at Your Own Risk

**Modifying the Chrome & Blood modlist forfeits the right to ask for support.**  
You are absolutely free to customize it — but **do so at your own risk**.

I will not be providing help, troubleshooting, or guidance for anyone who chooses to add, remove, or otherwise alter the list beyond the standard in-game mod settings or configuration options built into supported mods.

### 🧪 Want to Add Your Own Mods?

You can — just take precautions to avoid conflicts or accidental overwrites during updates:

1. **Install your mod** normally.
2. **Rename the mod folder** by adding `[NoDelete]` as a prefix.  
   **Example:**  
   - Original: `Immersive Car Horn`  
   - Modified: `[NoDelete] Immersive Car Horn`
3. This tag tells Wabbajack not to delete the mod during updates.
4. You may also use `[NoDelete]` for mods where you've customized config files (like `.ini`, `.json`, or `lua`).

### 🧠 Preserving Your Load Order (Optional)

If you’re making extensive changes, create a custom profile:

1. Click on the `Profile` dropdown in Mod Organizer and select **Manage...**
2. Duplicate the `Chrome & Blood` profile.
3. Rename it something like `[NoDelete] Custom Chrome`.
4. Use this new profile for your custom playthroughs.

> 🔔 **Note:** Even when using a `[NoDelete]` profile, you *still* need to add `[NoDelete]` to each individual mod folder you change or add.

Tweak responsibly. This list is tuned for stability, performance, and vibe — once you go off-script, it’s yours to maintain. 🛠
