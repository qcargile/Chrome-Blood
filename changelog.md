Huge patch aimed at keeping the modlist up to date.  
Update key points:

4. Added **Simple Flashlight**. *(Default Keybind set to Mouse Button 5)* Should significantly help with dark spaces in Night City.

### üñºÔ∏è Graphics Finalization & Visual Stability Pass

This patch finalizes the graphics foundation for **Chrome & Blood**.

**Ray Tracing (RT) and Path Tracing (PT)** setups combined with **Ultra Plus** should now have **exponentially better stability**.  
All graphics mods were carefully reviewed, and any causing instability, bugs, or minor visual degradation have been removed.

Some important notes for users:
- üåü **If you have an HDR monitor**, select an appropriate LUT via LUT Switcher for proper tone mapping.
- üì∏ **UI exposure flash warning**: After exiting menus (map, inventory, vehicle call, etc.), you may see a brief spike in brightness ‚Äî this is normal and resets within a second.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Refined Focus & Brutal Combat

This version of **Chrome & Blood** brings significant changes across graphics, combat, and overall direction.  
Several mods have been removed to reduce bloat, eliminate bugs, and create a more focused, purposeful experience. Graphics were further tuned with subtle fixes and quality updates.

Driving has been updated to feel tighter and more responsive, especially when drifting.

Most notably, **combat has been rebalanced again**. As stated in v1.12 ‚Äî **Chrome & Blood is designed for Very Hard difficulty.**  
You‚Äôre meant to die. But you‚Äôre also meant to feel the impact of upgrades. Every cyberware piece, iconic weapon, or key perk should feel like a milestone in your journey from street merc to **legend of Night City**.

<summary>v1.12 - April 19, 2025</summary>

### ‚öîÔ∏è Combat & Performance Overhaul
With v1.12, the recommended difficulty for Chrome & Blood shifts to **very hard**, and combat is finally in a state that feels good. **Time to kill for Tier 1‚Äì3 enemies is reasonable**, while elite enemies, MaxTac units, and bosses present a real challenge. Player survivability is reduced compared to vanilla, making every fight more intense and tactical. Using cover and finding opportune times to use healing items is key in order to avoid being sent to your death.

Additionally, **performance and stability have been substantially improved** from the first release. Those upgrading to v1.12 should immediately feel the difference in both gameplay flow and overall system stability.

This update is focused on making combat feel more like V has to *fight* their way through Night City to earn that end-game merc status.  
Early and mid-game progression will feel more challenging due to the removal of several mods that conflicted with **Enemies of Night City**, which now has full control over enemy scaling and behavior.

End-game balance remains strong thanks to the extensive customization available through cyberware, weapons, and mods.

> üõ†Ô∏è Combat difficulty and scaling can be adjusted at any time in the **Enemies of Night City** mod settings.
