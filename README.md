##  Introduction

**Chrome & Blood** is a complete *Cyberpunk 2077* overhaul, reforging the game into a darker, grittier, and more immersive experience.  
Every core system has been reworked ‚Äî from **AI** and **combat mechanics** to **stealth**, **hacking**, and **progression** ‚Äî delivering a challenging, rewarding sandbox.

- **Visual fidelity** is pushed to the limit with upgraded **lighting**, **weather**, and **textures**
- The **UI** has been redesigned with a sleek, diegetic aesthetic that feels native to Night City
- Combat is ruthless, with **enhanced enemy AI**, **overhauled behaviors**, and **lethal damage scaling** that punishes mistakes
- A massive arsenal of **new cosmetics, cyberware, vehicles, and weapons** to increase player build diversity

This isn‚Äôt just a modlist ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **full-blown reimagining** of what *Cyberpunk 2077* can be.

> *Step into Night City like you've never seen it before ‚Äî raw, ruthless, and dripping in chrome.*

## Post-Installation

### Antivirus Exceptions

>[!WARNING]
>Antivirus programs are notorious for false flagging [MO2's Virtual File System](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/Guide:Mod_Organizer/Advanced), which can and will cause crashes and other problems. Antivirus programs like BitDefender, Norton, and Webroot are especially aggressive, and you will need to fully remove them from your PC in order to actually launch the game through MO2. It is 2025, Windows Defender and being smart online is more than adequate to protect yourself from malicious software.

If you use Windows Defender, it is advised that you set up an exception for the modlist.

<Details>
<summary>Setting up Windows Defender Exceptions:</summary>

 1. Press the Windows Key.
 2. Type "Windows Defender" in the search bar and select "Windows Security".
 3. Click on "Virus & threat protection" in the left pane.
 4. Click the "Manage settings" option under "Virus & threat protection settings".
 5. Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions".
 6. Windows Defender will prompt you with a run as administrator screen, just hit yes.
 7. Click the "Add an exclusion" button at the top and choose "Folder".
 8. Navigate to your Install folder for the list and click "Select Folder".
 9. **(OPTIONAL)** You can repeat these steps for the other executables:
    - ModOrganizer.exe (`[Path to Modlist]\ModOrganizer.exe`)
