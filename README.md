##  Introduction

**Chrome & Blood** is a complete *Cyberpunk 2077* overhaul, reforging the game into a darker, grittier, and more immersive experience.  
Every core system has been reworked ‚Äî from **AI** and **combat mechanics** to **stealth**, **hacking**, and **progression** ‚Äî delivering a challenging, rewarding sandbox.

- **Visual fidelity** is pushed to the limit with upgraded **lighting**, **weather**, and **textures**
- The **UI** has been redesigned with a sleek, diegetic aesthetic that feels native to Night City
- Combat is ruthless, with **enhanced enemy AI**, **overhauled behaviors**, and **lethal damage scaling** that punishes mistakes
- A massive arsenal of **new cosmetics, cyberware, vehicles, and weapons** to increase player build diversity

This isn‚Äôt just a modlist ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **full-blown reimagining** of what *Cyberpunk 2077* can be.

> *Step into Night City like you've never seen it before ‚Äî raw, ruthless, and dripping in chrome.*

## üßπ Post-Installation

### üõ°Ô∏è Antivirus Exceptions

> Programs like **BitDefender**, **Norton**, and **Webroot** are especially aggressive ‚Äî you may need to fully **remove** them to get the game working through MO2.  
> It‚Äôs 2025 ‚Äî **Windows Defender + smart browsing habits** are more than enough to stay safe.

If you're using **Windows Defender**, it's strongly recommended to set up an exception for the modlist folder.
