<summary>v3.1 – December 21, 2025</summary>

## SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH v3.0 — NEW GAME NOT NEEDED

A focused follow-up update refining the 3.0 systems. This patch tightens progression pressure, adjusts late-game difficulty, stabilizes recently introduced mechanics, and expands weapon and cyberarm content while pruning or pausing mods that need more bake time.

---

## 🛠 Key Notes

- **Virtual Atelier Economy Rebalance**  
  Weapons sold through Virtual Atelier have been made significantly more expensive. Since these items are accessible at *any point* in the game, prices now reflect that convenience and prevent bypassing natural progression.

- **High-Level Damage Intake Adjusted**  
  Damage taken by the player at higher levels has been slightly increased to preserve threat and tension as builds mature.

- **Stability Pass (Temporary Disables)**  
  **Better Netrunning Fix** and **Armor Up** have been temporarily disabled due to instability in their current versions. These will be monitored and re-introduced once updates stabilize.

- **Black Budget Expansion**  
  **Black Budget: Classified Limbs – Iconic Cyberarms Pack** has been updated and now includes **21 iconic cyberarms**. Community pitches are welcome for future additions.

- **Weapon Modding Flow Improved**  
  **Unified Weapon Modification** has been added to streamline weapon modding into a more progression-based, readable system.

<summary>v3.0 – October 28, 2025 </summary>

# NEW GAME REQUIRED FOR 3.0!!!

Chrome and Blood 3.0 features a large gameplay rework that re-centers the list on meaningful progression, and brutal enemies. Changes include CyberwareEX additional slots, Better Netrunning subnet implementation, tuned ammo economy, weapons, driving, UI, graphics, enemy reinforcements, enemy alert state behaviour, and enemy quickhacking behaviour to match the new pacing. Additionally, mods that felt like overkill or random player cosmetics have been purged.

---

## CyberEx Slots tweaked to the following milestones:
- Extra Operating System Slot: `Edgerunner` 
- Extra Nervous System Slot: `Air Dash Level 3` 
- Extra Musculoskeletal System Slot: `Juggernaut` 
- Extra Frontal Cortex Slot: `Overclock Level 3` 
- Extra Cardiovascular Slot: `Adrenaline Rush Level 3` 
- Extra Integumentary Slot: `Built Different` 
- Extra Legs Slot: `Air Dash Level 1` 

---

## Better Netrunning Tweaks

The “one breach unlocks all” model has been removed. Networks now have independent security layers. You must breach *each subnet individually* (cameras, turrets, NPC access, etc.).

- Subnet access persists **8 in-game hours** after breaching a network before resetting.
- Remote Breach is now possible (cameras, turrets, vehicles, computers).
- Remote Breach success costs **100% total RAM**.
- Remote Breach failure **locks the network for 15 in-game minutes**.

### The following milestones are required to unlock quickhacks without the need for breaching (vanilla behaviour):

**Cyberdeck Tier**
- Basic Devices: `Tier 1 `
- Cameras: `Tier 2`
- Turrets: `Tier 3`
- NPCs (Covert): `Tier 3+` 
- NPCs (Combat): `Tier 4`
- NPCs (Control): `Tier 4+`
- NPCs (Ultimate): `Tier 5`

**INT Requirement**
- Basic Devices: `2 `
- Cameras: `9`
- Turrets: `12 `
- NPCs (Covert): `14 `
- NPCs (Combat): `16 `
- NPCs (Control): `18 `
- NPCs (Ultimate): `20` 

**Enemy Tier Caps (quickhacks will only work UP TO the enemy tier listed below)**
- NPCs (Covert): `Officer `
- NPCs (Combat): `Elite `
- NPCs (Control): `Boss`
- NPCs (Ultimate): `Maxtac`

---

## Armor Revamp (ArmorUp)

### What Changed
Armor is no longer passive damage reduction. It is now **Armor Integrity**, a consumable layer of protection that absorbs physical damage until depleted.

- 1 Armor = 1.5 Armor Integrity
- As long as Integrity > 0%, physical damage is reduced by **90%**
- 30% increased armor effectiveness (each point of armor grants 30% more damage reduction, meaning you stack reduction faster)
- Damage Reduction now reduces **integrity loss**, not incoming damage
- Integrity does **not** passively regenerate
- Must repair via Ripperdoc or ArmorUp consumables

This converts armor from infinite passive mitigation into a managed resource. The player is rewarded for timing, positioning, and disengagement.

---

## Combat & Enemy Scaling

### Player Scaling
Power creep at high levels has been toned down:
- Lvl 40: `-5% outgoing damage`
- Lvl 50: `-10% outgoing damage`
- Lvl 60: `-15% outgoing damage`
- Mechs take **1.0x** damage (was 1.5x)
- Headshot Multiplier: `-25% outgoing damage`
- Monowire: `+10% baseline damage`

### Enemy Scaling
Enemies now scale harder back into the player at high levels:
- Lvl 40: `+4% damage to V`
- Lvl 50: `+8% damage to V`
- Lvl 60: `+12% damage to V`

### Bosses
- Non–Beat-on-the-Brat bosses:  
  - Health Multiplier:  `2.6×` (was 1.5×)  
  - Damage Multiplier: `1.3×` (was 1.2×)
- Beat on the Brat bosses:
  - Slight nerf to health and damage multipliers (more fair at low chrome)
- MAX-TAC:
  - Health Multiplier: `1.4×` (was 1.2×)  
  - Damage multiplier unchanged

---

## Economy Adjustments

- Increased buy price of **Memory Chips** (Neuralware)
- Increased buy price of **Sabbath Atelier Glock pistols**
- Increased buy price of all apartments to fit the updated economy.
- Nerfed sell price of cyberware by 70%
- Removing weapon mods now require you to go to a vendor and pay a fee of 1k per mod upon selling the weapon, or dismantling the weapon altogether to get your mods back.


---

## Ammo & Crafting
- Slightly nerfed max ammo limits for sniper and shotgun weapons to 20 & 40 respectively.
- Increased the price multiplier for sniper and shotgun weapons to 10x and 20x respectively. (you can only even carry 20/40 at a time, so this evens out.)

**Craft Yields For Ammo Crafting**
| Type | Per Craft |
|------|-----------|
| Handgun | 72 |
| Heavy | 144 |
| Shotgun | 10 |
| Sniper | 5 |

Craft cost = 8 components → takes ~4–5 crafts to cap each ammo pool PER AMMO TYPE.
---

## Weapon Tweaks
### Nerfed armor piercing muzzle attachments to the following:
- Rare: `+10% headshot multiplier, +10% armor penetration `
- Epic: `+15% headshot multiplier, +15% armor penetration` 
- Legendary: `+20% headshot multiplier, +20% armor penetration`

---

## Driving & Handling

Vehicle physics reworked for more responsive handling:
- Easier drift entry and exit
- Higher responsiveness for braking/turning/acceleration

---

## LHUD & UI Tweaks

- LHUD UI elements contextual triggers tweaked to make more sense. Health and Stamina appear if not at 100% in combat, minimap appears when holding right click to zoom or in a vehicle, combat UI elements appear when weapon is drawn.
- Loot markers on the standard profile has been changed to "Line Of Sight" instead of only visible through scanning. Immersive profile is still *scanning only.*

---

## Graphical Tweaks

ENV Tuner settings adjusted to fix extreme glare and overbloom:
- Reduced blinding daylight exposure
- Improved nighttime visibility
- A custom Chrome & Blood HUD PAINTER preset was added to establish a color palette identity for the list.

---

## Enemy Reinforcements

- Minimum delay to call backup lowered to **18 seconds**

---

## Enemy Quickhacks & Netrunners

### Net Runners
- Netrunner spawn rates across different factions has been buffed across the board.
- Enemy behaviour concerning quickhacks has been nerfed. Only actual netrunners and elites/bosses can trace the player, after receiving a direct quickhack. (Previously, they could trace the player if ANY enemy on the network was hacked.)
- **NO** enemy types can utilize the system collapse quickhack anymore.

### Hacks
- Minimum time for quickhacks from same enemy: 20 seconds 
- Minimum Delay between any two hacks: 10 seconds

This means an individual enemy can only hack the player every 20 seconds, and globally the player can't be hacked more than once every 10 seconds.

---

## Stealth Behavior

- Enemies are now more cautious after entering an "alert" state (searching for the player, but not actively in combat) and have a randomized time range for when every enemy in the alert state will go back to normal.
- Silenced pistol shots now aggro all hit targets `within 35m` if the target is not killed. If engaged from further than 35m, you have 2 shots before the target is automatically aggro'd.

<summary>v2.34 – October 4, 2025</summary>

## 🛠 Key Notes:
1. **You're a merc, V. Not a trash collector! (Economy Overhaul)**
   - **Core design:** Jobs and contracts (gigs, psychos, bounties) are now the main income source; loot serves as supplemental cash. This includes low-level bounty targets at NCPD type missions.
   - **Rewards: (100 - 20k range)** Boosted money shards, larger open-world money cache finds, and re-scaled activity earnings (fights, races, and arcades).
   - **Quests & Gigs: (15k - 100k range)** All fixer payouts re-tiered with clearer progression—late-game fixers (Rogue, Hands, Wakako) now pay significantly more.
   - **Cyberpsychos & Bounties: (35k - 60k range)** Non-lethal captures pay a premium; Named boss-level bounties deliver large single-contract rewards.
   - **Phantom Liberty: (15k - 200k range)** Hands and El Capitan gigs scaled up; main quest cash rewards up to 200k to reflect the high stakes of the PL DLC quest line.
   - **Prices & Sinks: (Least Expensive items - 20k / Most Expensive Items - 1 mil)** Weapons, vehicles, cyberware, and quickhacks re-priced to create a smoother mid-game and meaningful late-game economy.
   - **Sell Prices:** Weapons sell for `75%` less than vanilla prices, while cyberware sells for `25%` more. This was done to drive home the fact V is a merc who should be paid from jobs, not collecting & selling whatever trash they find on the street.
   
2. Minimal combat tweaks overall; Immersive profile received some more realism (reloading discards whatever ammo was still in your magazine) while the standard profile picked up FreeRunner.

3. Added some more graphical, clothing, vehicle, and QoL type mods.

4.  [Black Budget - Iconic Cyberarms Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/24673) added to the list.

5.  "Romanced Enhanced" mods reenabled. "Romance Hangouts Enhanced" still disabled, pending updates.

6.  [FAQ](https://github.com/qcargile/Chrome-Blood/blob/main/Modlist/FAQ.md) created.

<summary>v2.32 – August 31, 2025</summary>

## SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH v2.31!! NEW GAME NOT NEEDED.

## 🛠 Key Notes:
1. This update introduces a new immersive profile built for **hardcore realism**, emphasizing gameplay over cosmetics or UI convenience:

   - **Dark Future**: Adds environmental darkness, needs management, and minimizes player reliance on UI.
   - **Immersive Cyberware**: Locks basic features like scanner, inventory, and healthbar behind cyberware upgrades.
   - **Limited HUD**: Disables key UI elements during combat, driving, and stealth to increase immersion.
   - **Wannabe Edgerunner**: Introduces cyberpsychosis mechanics as a tradeoff for excessive cyberware usage.
   - **Virtual Atelier Delivery**: Adds timed delivery delays to virtual shop purchases, encouraging planning.

   All cosmetic mods (e.g., body types, clothing, customization) are disabled in this profile to maintain focus on challenge and progression.  
   The standard profile remains unchanged with all customization and quality-of-life features intact.
2. Modded weapon progression has been reworked. Sabbath weapons now appear across Tiers 1–5 and are only accessible through their own atelier. Other added weapons appear in stores at level 33 or in secret placements.
3. Many bugs fixed, with major mod updates and compatibility checks.
4. CyberwareEX cyberware slot unlocks reworked to the following progression perk milestones:
   - Legs: `Air Dash 3/3`
   - Arms: `Ambidextrous`
   - Integumentary: `License To Chrome 2/3`
   - Cardiovascular: `Adrenaline Rush 3/3`
   - Frontal Cortex: `Overclock 3/3`
   - Eyes: `Focus 2/2`
   - OS: `Edgerunner`
5. Economy rebalance: increased payouts for quests, gigs, and shards. Cyberpsychos now reward 15,000 for kills and 25,000 for non-lethal takedowns.

2. Introduction of [Chrome Ballistics - Weapon Rebalance](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22819?tab=description) to bring weapon base DPS to that low TTK mark that we all enjoy.
3. General mod updates, as always.

<summary>v2.2 - July 9th, 2025</summary>

<details>
<summary>SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH v2.01 BY FOLLOWING THESE STEPS!</summary>

1. Travel to V's H10 starting apartment.
2. Make sure Judy/Panam/River/Kerry is not currently visiting AND that you do not have the Long/Short stay options waiting in the phone message(s) from the I really want to stay at your House mod series
3. Make a new manual save, and exit the game
4. Update the list
5. Reload the save you made in step 2, and you should be good to go. THIS WORKED FOR ME BUT I CAN NOT GUARANTEE 100% SAVE SAFES, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

</details>

## ⚔️ Chrome & Blood v2.2 – Total Damage Rebalance

### 🧠 Key Notes:
1. Complete revamp of damage and weapon scaling, aiming for low TTK, and bringing every weapon archetype up to end game status. If you want to use a pistol the entire game, that's what I'm trying to make possible.
2. Huge list bloat purge to improve stability and fix a lot of user-reported bugs.
3. Standard mod updates to incorporate new features from authors.
4. More content through gun/clothing/vehicle mods.

## SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH v2.0!! NEW GAME NOT NEEDED.

This will likely be the final update before the arrival of patch **2.3**.

**IMPORTANT:** Ahead of the 2.3 patch, make sure you [disable auto updates](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-users/users-modding-cyberpunk-2077/users-downgrading-preventing-auto-updates) on Steam or GOG.  
Chrome & Blood **will not update** to 2.3 until *all major frameworks* have been verified and updated by the community.

### 🔑 Key Notes:
1. **Ammo Limiter** introduced to encourage actual inventory management — no more carrying infinite ammo into every fight.
2. **Damage Scaling and Balance - Extended** (created by me) added for additional tuning options.
3. More **weapon customization** with added suppressors and muzzles.
4. General mod maintenance and updates across the board.

<summary>SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH v1.19 BY FOLLOWING THESE STEPS!</summary>

1. Travel to V's H10 starting apartment.
2. Make a new manual save, and exit the game
3. Update the list
4. Reload the save you made in step 2, and you should be good to go. THIS WORKED FOR ME BUT I CAN NOT GUARANTEE 100% SAVE SAFES, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

## 🚨 Chrome & Blood v2.0

Welcome to **Chrome & Blood v2.0** — a monumental update that trims bloat, boosts stability, and introduces the long-awaited [**Reinforcements mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21532) by [Phoenicia](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Phoenicia4?gameId=3333).

### 🔑 Key Points:
1. Removed tons of problematic and bloat-heavy mods.
2. Updated numerous core mods.
3. Slightly reworked vehicle handling and responsiveness.
4. **Added Reinforcements** — factions can now **call in backup mid-fight**. Even a street-level brawl can snowball into a multi-wave firefight. **Arasaka, Militech, and Animals** will hit you hardest, while groups like **Scavs** or **Voodoo Boys** provide a more manageable threat.

> 💡 **Tip:** Prioritize enemies who are attempting calls. On faction turf? Hit fast and vanish — reinforcements don't hesitate.

### 🖼️ Graphics Finalization & Visual Stability Pass

This patch finalizes the graphics foundation for **Chrome & Blood**.

**Ray Tracing (RT) and Path Tracing (PT)** setups combined with **Ultra Plus** should now have **exponentially better stability**.  
All graphics mods were carefully reviewed, and any causing instability, bugs, or minor visual degradation have been removed.

Some important notes for users:
- 🌟 **If you have an HDR monitor**, select an appropriate LUT via LUT Switcher for proper tone mapping.
- 📸 **UI exposure flash warning**: After exiting menus (map, inventory, vehicle call, etc.), you may see a brief spike in brightness — this is normal and resets within a second.

🛠️ Please continue reporting any graphical issues to help fine-tune the experience!

### 🎨 LUT Freedom + Bug Fixes

This update includes minor bug fixes and a major addition: **LUT Switcher 2**.  
You can now change your game's LUT *on the fly* using the CET menu — giving you access to **hundreds of visual styles** mid-game. Tailor the tone of your Night City to match your mood.

I’ve also adjusted settings for **Better Netrunning** and **Radial Breach**.  
If you're finding the default configurations too punishing, **don’t forget to tweak them** through the in-game mod settings.

This version of **Chrome & Blood** brings significant changes across graphics, combat, and overall direction.  
Several mods have been removed to reduce bloat, eliminate bugs, and create a more focused, purposeful experience. Graphics were further tuned with subtle fixes and quality updates.

Driving has been updated to feel tighter and more responsive, especially when drifting.

Most notably, **combat has been rebalanced again**. As stated in v1.12 — **Chrome & Blood is designed for Very Hard difficulty.**  
You’re meant to die. But you’re also meant to feel the impact of upgrades. Every cyberware piece, iconic weapon, or key perk should feel like a milestone in your journey from street merc to **legend of Night City**.

<summary>v1.12 - April 19, 2025</summary>

### ⚔️ Combat & Performance Overhaul
With v1.12, the recommended difficulty for Chrome & Blood shifts to **very hard**, and combat is finally in a state that feels good. **Time to kill for Tier 1–3 enemies is reasonable**, while elite enemies, MaxTac units, and bosses present a real challenge. Player survivability is reduced compared to vanilla, making every fight more intense and tactical. Using cover and finding opportune times to use healing items is key in order to avoid being sent to your death.

Additionally, **performance and stability have been substantially improved** from the first release. Those upgrading to v1.12 should immediately feel the difference in both gameplay flow and overall system stability.

This update is focused on making combat feel more like V has to *fight* their way through Night City to earn that end-game merc status.  
Early and mid-game progression will feel more challenging due to the removal of several mods that conflicted with **Enemies of Night City**, which now has full control over enemy scaling and behavior.

End-game balance remains strong thanks to the extensive customization available through cyberware, weapons, and mods.

> 🛠️ Combat difficulty and scaling can be adjusted at any time in the **Enemies of Night City** mod settings.
