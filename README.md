## Introduction

Chrome & Blood is a complete Cyberpunk 2077 overhaul built to reforge the game into a darker, grittier, and more immersive experience. Every core system has been reworked—from AI and combat mechanics to stealth, hacking, and progression—creating a more challenging and rewarding sandbox. The visual fidelity is pushed to the limit with upgraded lighting, weather, and textures, while the UI has been completely redesigned for a sleek, diegetic look that feels native to the world. Players can fully customize both male and female V with a huge selection of new cosmetics, cyberware, vehicles, and weapons, giving every playthrough a unique aesthetic. This is more than just a modlist — it's a full-blown reimagining of what Cyberpunk 2077 can be.

Step into Night City like you've never seen it before—raw, ruthless, and dripping in chrome.

### System Requirements

Based on both internal performance testing and user feedback, the section below outlines my *recommended* system specifications for the list. Please keep in mind that every PC is different, and these recommendations are an estimate based on available data and firsthand reports. Individual performance may vary depending on specific hardware and software configurations, as well as other system optimizations. **Troubleshooting & support for hardware related issues will not be provided.**

>[!WARNING]

<summary>Clarification on PC Requirements</summary>

For complete clarity, my PC specs while building the list were a **LAPTOP** 7945X3D, 4080, and 32GB @ 5200mhz of RAM. This PC ran the list @ 60-100FPS on 2560x1600 (16:10) WITH RT & PT.  
My current specs are a 7800X3D, 3080 (10gb), and 32GB of RAM with some BIOS tweaks (e.g., [ReBar](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-30-series-resizable-bar-support/) and [PBO](https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/understanding-precision-boost-overdrive-in-three-easy-steps/ba-p/416136)). This PC runs the list @ stable (locked) 61FPS on 1440p (16:9).
