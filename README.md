## Introduction

Chrome & Blood is a complete Cyberpunk 2077 overhaul built to reforge the game into a darker, grittier, and more immersive experience. Every core system has been reworked—from AI and combat mechanics to stealth, hacking, and progression—creating a more challenging and rewarding sandbox. The visual fidelity is pushed to the limit with upgraded lighting, weather, and textures, while the UI has been completely redesigned for a sleek, diegetic look that feels native to the world. Players can fully customize both male and female V with a huge selection of new cosmetics, cyberware, vehicles, and weapons, giving every playthrough a unique aesthetic. This is more than just a modlist — it's a full-blown reimagining of what Cyberpunk 2077 can be.

Step into Night City like you've never seen it before—raw, ruthless, and dripping in chrome.
