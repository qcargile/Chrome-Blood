## Introduction

**Chrome & Blood** is a complete *Cyberpunk 2077* overhaul built for players who want a faster, immersive, progression focused and more dangerous Night City.  
Every core system has been reworked, from **combat** and **AI** to **economy**, **hacking**, **cyberware**, and **stealth**, turning the game into a brutal, reactive sandbox where builds matter and survival is earned.

- **Visual fidelity** pushed to the limit with [ReLUX](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20808), [Nova City 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/12490), HDR LUTs, and optimized weather/LOD/fog
- **Combat redefined** with faster TTK, smarter AI, faction-based [reinforcements](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21532), and [Enemies of Night City](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/8467) as the foundation
- **Weapon rebalance** via [Chrome Ballistics](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22819) and [Damage Scaling and Balance](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21865) ensuring every archetype is viable
- **Cyberware depth** with [Neuralware - Chipware Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/19798) and [Cyberware Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/23554) series
- **Perk expansion** through [Merc Protocol](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/26751), adding 18 new perks with unique mechanics built specifically for Chrome & Blood
- **Vehicles** with custom handling, [Nitrous](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20675) integration, and a full library of lore-friendly cars and bikes
- **Immersion systems** like [Immersive Fixers](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15460), ammo limits, bounty hunting, and enhanced ripperdoc functionality

> *Step into a Night City where it takes more than just chrome to become a legend...*

### 🧠 Choose Your Playstyle

**Chrome & Blood** supports two distinct install profiles depending on the kind of experience you want:

#### Immersive Profile
A stripped-down, survival-focused version of the game that prioritizes gameplay, tactics, and immersion.
- Darker visuals, needs management, and UI restrictions via [Dark Future](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/16300)
- Locked HUD elements (minimap, 3rd person driving, health bars) through [Immersive Cyberware](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21916)
- HUD dynamically hidden unless specific context triggers are met with [Limited HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2592)
- Scripted delays for in-game deliveries via [Virtual Atelier Delivery](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/21482)

#### Standard Profile
The same deadly rework of Cyberpunk 2077, but without the survival and immersion restrictions.
- Full UI and inventory access from the beginning
- No cyberpsychosis or humanity management
- No needs system or HUD limitations

#### Cosmetics & Customization
As of v3.2, all cosmetic mods have been removed from both profiles. Chrome & Blood is now a fully gameplay-focused list, giving users the freedom to add their own preferred cosmetic mods. Use the `[NoDelete]` tag in MO2 to preserve any personal additions across updates.

---

Both profiles retain the same core gameplay balance, but differ in *how much freedom vs. friction* you want in your journey through Night City.

as **installed** in your library before proceeding.

## 🚀 Installation

You can install Chrome & Blood from either [**Nexus Mods**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20942?tab=description)  
**OR** via [**Wabbajack**](https://www.wabbajack.org/gallery?selectedGame=Cyberpunk%202077&nsfw=true&showUnofficial=true)

---

### 📥 Wabbajack Installation Instructions

1. **Download [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org)**  
   Place it in a folder **away** from your Cyberpunk 2077 installation and **outside of protected directories**  
   > Recommended: `D:\Wabbajack`

2. Launch **Wabbajack**, then go to **"Browse Modlists"**

3. Under the search bar, apply the following filters:
   - ✅ Filter by: **Cyberpunk 2077**
   - ✅ Tick: **Non-Featured**

4. Search for **"Chrome & Blood"** if it doesn’t appear immediately

5. Click the **modlist cover art**, then download and install

6. Choose installation paths:
   - **Installation directory**: `D:\Wabbajack\Chrome & Blood`
   - **Download directory**: `D:\Wabbajack\downloads`  OR `D:\Wabbajack\Chrome & Blood\downloads` 
*Having a central wabbajack downloads folder allows different lists to share archive files if they use the same mod.*
   > ⚠️ Both directories should be on the **same drive** as your Cyberpunk 2077 install  
   > Do **not** install to `Program Files` or your game directory

7. Click **Install** and wait for Wabbajack to complete the process

8. After installation, open the folder where the modlist was installed and run `ModOrganizer.exe`

9. In **Mod Organizer 2**, click the **Run** button (top right) to launch **Chrome & Blood**



## 🧹 Post-Installation

### 🛡️ Antivirus Exceptions

> [!WARNING]  
> Antivirus programs are **notorious** for false-flagging [MO2's Virtual File System](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/Guide:Mod_Organizer/Advanced), which can cause **crashes, launch failures**, and other issues.  
> Programs like **BitDefender**, **Norton**, and **Webroot** are especially aggressive — you may need to fully **remove** them to get the game working through MO2.  
> It’s 2025 — **Windows Defender + smart browsing habits** are more than enough to stay safe.

If you're using **Windows Defender**, it's strongly recommended to set up an exception for the modlist folder.

<details>

## 🐞 Known Issues

> Below is a list of currently known issues with Chrome & Blood. These are being monitored and will be addressed in future updates where possible.

---

### 1. CTD When Selecting Clothing in Virtual Atelier  
**Responsible Mod(s):** Virtual Atelier + Gender-Locked Clothing Mods

**Issue:**  
Selecting clothing items intended for the opposite gender in any Virtual Atelier store will result in an immediate crash to desktop (CTD). This occurs because some clothing mods are not configured for both body types.

**Fix:**  
Be aware of the gender-lock on certain cosmetic items.  
Avoid selecting items not intended for your character’s body type in the Atelier UI.  
Refer to the preview images provided below. Picture 1 will cause a crash. Picture 2 is what it should look like if compatible.
