# ⚙️ Chrome & Blood - Mod Settings Tuning Guide

Welcome to **Chrome & Blood**, my custom Cyberpunk 2077 modlist focused on immersion, enhanced visuals, extended content, and combat realism. This guide is here to help you **tune the mod settings** that matter most — the ones that *will* affect how the game feels, plays, and performs.

Some mods in this list are **highly customizable** and meant to be **tweaked to your liking**. Below you'll find what I recommend checking out and adjusting based on your playstyle, hardware, and taste.

## 🧠 HUD & Interface

### `HUDitor` & `HUD Painter`
- Used to **reposition, recolor, and declutter** the HUD.
- I recommend using these to achieve either a minimal HUD look or a classic cyber-UI vibe — up to you.
- Launch via CET overlay or Native Settings menu.

### `Preem Scanner`
- Lets you style your scanner with **cleaner visuals** and reduced overlay noise.
- I include a Monochrome Addon that gives a crisp, retro-futuristic look.

## 🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics

### `Stealthrunner`
- Expands stealth mechanics with more nuanced detection and behavior.
- Tweak how forgiving stealth is, how alert enemies behave, and how stealth perks scale.
- If you’re playing a Netrunner or Assassin-type build, absolutely dive into the settings.

### `Combat Revolution` & `Enemies of Night City`
- These overhaul combat AI and encounter dynamics.
- You can dial up or down enemy aggression, accuracy, and awareness — depending on whether you want chaos or control.

### `They Will Remember`
- Adds a system for **persistent reputation** based on your violent actions.
- You can adjust how quickly people react to your past, or disable it for a cleaner sandbox-style play.

---

## 🤖 Cyberware & Combat

### `CyberwareEX` 
- I’ve expanded cyberware functionality with these.
- You can enable extra implant slots, adjust restrictions, and customize loadout balance.
- Perfect for people going for full Borg/Edgerunner builds.

### `Wannabe Edgerunner`
- Optional cyberpsychosis system. Super customizable.
- If you want risk to go with power, tweak it to make mental collapse a threat. Or tone it down for more forgiveness.

### `Guns Redone V3`
- Adjusts weapon recoil, spread, damage, and armor interactions.
- Works with vanilla and most custom weapons. Choose presets or fine-tune for your favorite weapon class.

---

## 🚗 Vehicles & Driving

### `Enhanced Vehicle System`
- Core mod for improving driving physics and realism.
- This & `Gripped Up` tune traction and control.
- You can also set your own field of view and speed sensitivity.

### `Auto Drive` (and addons)
- If you want hands-off travel, you can ride passenger or have your car drive itself.
- Optional detours, cinematic paths, and delay settings can be tweaked.

---

## 🌆 Visuals & Graphics

### `ReLUX`, `Nova LUT`, `Ultra Fog`, `Preem Water`
- These overhaul lighting, fog density, weather, and water effects.
- You *will* want to experiment to find your preferred LUT or reduce fog if you're seeing frame drops.
- Tweak visual style between hyperreal, noir, or neon as you see fit.

### `FX Begone`, `ReFlash`, `ReGlass`
- Removes intrusive effects like vignette, chromatic aberration, inventory blur, and holocall noise.
- Adjust to reduce eye strain or go full cinematic.

---

## 🧩 Quality of Life

### `Equipment-EX`
- Lets you add custom outfit slots, accessory support, and more.
- If you use the wardrobe or frequently swap builds, check the settings for outfit memory and UI behavior.

### `Immersive Interaction`, `Hangout Romances`, `Immersive Fixers`
- These add world interaction layers and deeper relationship content.
- Configure how often hangouts occur and whether they tie into story beats or stay sandboxed.

---

## 🧰 Frameworks & Utilities

### `Mod Settings` + `Native Settings UI`
- This is where most of the above mods get configured.
- Open from the pause menu or use the side menu extension.
- Highly recommend checking these menus **after every major mod install** — don’t miss useful toggles.

---

## ✅ Final Tips

- **Back up your configs**: Especially CET and NativeSettings tweaks after your first setup session.
- **Test before committing**: Run through Dogtown or Watson to stress-test visuals and combat after tweaks.
- **Be smart with stacking**: Too many overlapping AI/gameplay overhauls can create conflicts — so tweak incrementally.
