---

This update is focused on making combat feel more like V has to *fight* their way through Night City to earn that end-game merc status.  
Early and mid-game progression will feel more challenging due to the removal of several mods that conflicted with **Enemies of Night City**, which now has full control over enemy scaling and behavior.

End-game balance remains strong thanks to the extensive customization available through cyberware, weapons, and mods.

> üõ†Ô∏è Combat difficulty and scaling can be adjusted at any time in the **Enemies of Night City** mod settings.
