## üß† HUD & Interface

### `HUD Painter`
- Used to ** recolor** the HUD.

### `Preem Scanner`
- Lets you style your scanner with **cleaner visuals** and reduced overlay noise.
- I include a Monochrome Addon that gives a crisp, retro-futuristic look.

## üéÆ Gameplay & Mechanics

### `Stealthrunner`
- Expands stealth mechanics with more nuanced detection and behavior.
- Tweak how forgiving stealth is, how alert enemies behave, and how stealth perks scale.
- If you‚Äôre playing a Netrunner or Assassin-type build, absolutely dive into the settings.

### `Enemies of Night City`
- These overhaul combat AI and encounter dynamics.
- You can dial up or down enemy aggression, accuracy, and awareness ‚Äî depending on whether you want chaos or control.

### `Scrapper`
- Automatically scraps tier 1‚Äì5 weapons, attachments, clothing, quickhacks, and mods on pickup.
- Incredibly useful for loot-heavy playthroughs, but highly recommended to tweak the settings first so you don‚Äôt destroy gear you actually want to use.
- You can exclude specific categories or tiers through the settings panel ‚Äî don‚Äôt skip this if you're running a heavily modified loot economy.

### `Radial Breach`
- Allows you to cast **Breach Protocol in a radial AOE**, affecting all nearby enemies.
- Encourages fast-paced netrunner gameplay with fewer pauses for manual breaches.
- Settings allow radius scaling, RAM cost, and effect duration customization.

### `Enhanced Weakspot - Vulnerability Analytics Tweaks`
- Improves how **weakspots and vulnerability analysis** are detected and rewarded.
- Adds new mechanics to encourage targeting limbs and gear-based vulnerabilities.
- Offers toggles and sliders for scan time, damage bonuses, and enemy responsiveness.

- Great for immersive and reactive netrunner builds. Includes toggleable enemy interrupt resistance, hack radius, and access times.
- Highly recommended for players who rely on stealth, hacking, and sensor control.

## ü§ñ Cyberware & Combat

### `CyberwareEX` 
- I‚Äôve expanded cyberware functionality with this.
- You can enable extra implant slots, adjust restrictions, and customize loadout balance.
- Perfect for people going for full Borg/Edgerunner builds.

### `Wannabe Edgerunner`
- Optional cyberpsychosis system. Super customizable.

### `Guns Redone V3`
- Adjusts weapon recoil, spread, damage, and armor interactions.
- Works with vanilla and most custom weapons. Choose presets or fine-tune for your favorite weapon class.

## üåÜ Visuals & Graphics

### `LUT Switcher 2`
- Lets you **swap LUTs on the fly** using the CET overlay.
- Hundreds of LUTs available across multiple styles: vibrant, noir, cyberpunk neon, muted realism, etc.

### `Improved Distant Shadows`

## üß© Quality of Life

### `Equipment-EX`
- Lets you add custom outfit slots, accessory support, and more.
- If you use the wardrobe or frequently swap builds, check the settings for outfit memory and UI behavior.

### `Immersive Interaction`, `Hangout Romances`, `Immersive Fixers`
- These add world interaction layers and deeper relationship content.
- Configure how often hangouts occur and whether they tie into story beats or stay sandboxed.

---

## üß∞ Frameworks & Utilities

### `Mod Settings` + `Native Settings UI`
- This is where most of the above mods get configured.
- Open from the pause menu or use the side menu extension.
- Highly recommend checking these menus **after every major mod install** ‚Äî don‚Äôt miss useful toggles.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Tips

- **Back up your configs**: Especially CET and NativeSettings tweaks after your first setup session.
- **Test before committing**: Run through Dogtown or Watson to stress-test visuals and combat after tweaks.
- **Be smart with stacking**: Too many overlapping AI/gameplay overhauls can create conflicts ‚Äî so tweak incrementally.
