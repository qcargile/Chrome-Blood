## Introduction

Chrome & Blood is a complete Cyberpunk 2077 overhaul built to reforge the game into a darker, grittier, and more immersive experience. Every core system has been reworkedâ€”from AI and combat mechanics to stealth, hacking, and progressionâ€”creating a more challenging and rewarding sandbox. The visual fidelity is pushed to the limit with upgraded lighting, weather, and textures, while the UI has been completely redesigned for a sleek, diegetic look that feels native to the world. Players can fully customize both male and female V with a huge selection of new cosmetics, cyberware, vehicles, and weapons, giving every playthrough a unique aesthetic. This is more than just a modlist â€” it's a full-blown reimagining of what Cyberpunk 2077 can be.

Step into Night City like you've never seen it beforeâ€”raw, ruthless, and dripping in chrome.

## Post-Installation

### Antivirus Exceptions

>[!WARNING]
>Antivirus programs are notorious for false flagging [MO2's Virtual File System](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/Guide:Mod_Organizer/Advanced), which can and will cause crashes and other problems. Antivirus programs like BitDefender, Norton, and Webroot are especially aggressive, and you will need to fully remove them from your PC in order to actually launch the game through MO2. It is 2025, Windows Defender and being smart online is more than adequate to protect yourself from malicious software.

If you use Windows Defender, it is advised that you set up an exception for the modlist.

<Details>
<summary>Setting up Windows Defender Exceptions:</summary>

 1. Press the Windows Key.
 2. Type "Windows Defender" in the search bar and select "Windows Security".
 3. Click on "Virus & threat protection" in the left pane.
 4. Click the "Manage settings" option under "Virus & threat protection settings".
 5. Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions".
 6. Windows Defender will prompt you with a run as administrator screen, just hit yes.
 7. Click the "Add an exclusion" button at the top and choose "Folder".
 8. Navigate to your Install folder for the list and click "Select Folder".
 9. **(OPTIONAL)** You can repeat these steps for the other executables:
